# Random-Files
#### Introduction

Just some lang files for minecraft mods and maybe more...
Well, mostly mods' lang files. There are so many great mods out there and I dont have time to translate all of them.
Thus I will put those lang files here so that I can translate them when I'm free, or you can help me to translate them if you are willing to.

#### Requirement

Of course you are allowed to update all the localization files and I will always appreciate that. But there are some basic requirements.
      1. The translation should be accurate...well, at least be correct.
      2. The translation should be neat and ordered.
      

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me.
