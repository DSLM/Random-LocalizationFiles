## Random-Files
#### Introduction

Just some lang files for minecraft mods and maybe more...Well, mostly mods' lang files. There are so many great mods out there and I dont have time to translate all of them. There are also some lang files that I've already finished translation but I don't know where to put them. Thus I will put those lang files here so that I can translate or update them when I'm free, or you can help me to translate them if you are willing to.

#### Requirement

Of course you are allowed to update all the localization files and I will always appreciate that. You can also put new language files here if you want. But there are some basic requirements.
    
    1.The translation should be accurate...well, at least be correct.
    
    2.The translation should be neat and ordered.

    3.Put your lang files in the proper folders with correct names.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me.
